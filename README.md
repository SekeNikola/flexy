### Responsive grid system
The grid system is based on Bootstrap 4 classes for the full responsive app. There is also margin and padding classes. For full documentation click here.

### Normalize CSS
" Normalize.css makes browsers render all elements more consistently and in line with modern standards. It precisely targets only the styles that need normalizing."

### Custom classes
Some of the custom classes are text-left, text-right and text-center to align your elements. Sometimes you just need to position elements in the middle of the container and thats where middle-col and middle-row classes enter. Don't forget to set the height of the container.
